I bought this programmer from [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/200944364396). I was happy with my DIY Serial Programmer, but I had to change/upgrade my old PC, and none of the new PCs in market, has a serial port anymore. DAMN... so, I was OBLIGED to get a new one, an USB port based.

The "PIC K150 USB Microcontroller Programmer with ICSP Cable"
Is a programming tool designed to program and interface with microcontrollers from the PIC (Peripheral Interface Controller) family. It's often used for programming PIC microcontrollers with new firmware or code, allowing you to update or modify the behavior of the microcontroller.
Here's an overview of its key features:
PIC Microcontroller Support: The programmer is specifically designed to work with PIC microcontrollers, which are a family of microcontrollers developed by Microchip Technology. PIC microcontrollers are widely used in various embedded systems and electronic projects.

USB Interface: The programmer connects to your computer via a USB interface. This allows you to use your computer to control and program PIC microcontrollers.

ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) Support: The programmer supports ICSP, which means it can program the microcontroller while it's connected to the target circuit without needing to remove the chip from the circuit board. This is particularly convenient for projects where soldering and desoldering chips could be complex.

Programming Software: To use the programmer, you'll typically need to install programming software on your computer. This software provides an interface for selecting the PIC microcontroller model, loading firmware code, and initiating the programming process.

Programming Cable: The programmer often comes with an ICSP programming cable. This cable is used to connect the programmer to the target PIC microcontroller on your circuit board.

Adapter Boards: Depending on the specific version of the PIC K150 programmer, it might come with adapter boards that allow you to connect different types of PIC microcontrollers. These adapter boards ensure proper alignment and compatibility with various PIC package types.

LED Indicators: The programmer might have LED indicators that provide feedback about the programming process, such as power status, data transfer, and programming completion.
